# Broad Themes of Chinese Development 
*Q* What is the appropriate pace of reforms? China has always pushed a gradualist pace of reform.
*Q* How much of the basic for a market-based economy does a country need to have in place to achieve rapid growth?
	- China: a relatively slows, incomplete shift to a market-economy, but has highly successful growth
*Q* How has China balanced urban rural interests
*Q* How have SOEs evolved and, most controversially, what is their future role in China?

## Timeline
1940-1970s: Revolutionary reform based intially on the Soviet Model 
	- SOEs are 77\% of industrial output
	- Collectivization of agriculture
	- State control of banks
	- State planning and allocation of resources
*Q* What is the *Great Leap Foward*

1970s: Cultural revolutions comes to end and Mao dies, causing public dissatisfaction
1978-1989: **Deng Xiaoping** rises to power
	- intiaited many economic reforms
	- inacted socialism with Chinese characteristics 
2007-2008: The inversion for AE success
2015: SOE begin to become more profitable than private within AEs

Today: China is still shooting for a high GDP benchmark but will not be able to achieve such a rapid growth rate (+10%)
due to...
	- size/growth of population (including One Child Policy)
	- Average level of education has about reached its ceiling
	- Workforce participation in urban areas has already taken most of the agricultural sector
Thus, growth will now be based on investment into Chinese firms.
	  
## Deng's Reforms
- Dismangle agricultural collectives, allowing individuals to create output and family plots
	+ controversial at first, but caused strong increase in agricultural output
	+ Some agricultural labor freed up for use in other areas (e.g. TVEs)
	+ Agriculuture as a model for other reforms 
- Establish TVEs - town and village enterprises (quasi private)
- Invite inward foreign direct investment
- Creation of "Special Economic Zones" to encourage (and contain?) FDI
	+ Allowed for more radical changes and experimentation (Shanghai Free Trade Zone of 2014)
	+ Businesses with weaker links to the domestic econ, thus more open to international trade (also restricted domestic markets)
	+ Special tax incentives for FDI and especially join ventures
- One Child Policy
*Q* Why was the One Child Policy enacted

	> Note: Overtime, the services sectorial contribution to China's GDP has increased.

## Dual Track System
- Using experiments from agricultural reforms, but allow private marketing of production in excess of requirements
- Result: Dual Prices
	+ Plan prices for quota from factories
	+ All excess production is then sold at private market prices (incentivizing factory managers)
- Keep plan amounts fixed, growth in output goes to the market
	+ this decontrol of prices cause (1) people to buy low plan priced inputs, sell some output at high market prices, 
	  (2) and decontrol of prices contributed to spike in inflation in the late 1980s
	+ Incentives may have increase productivity of SOEs managers 

## Second Reform Period (1993-Present)

- New backdrop was a conservative resistance to more market reforms within CCP
- Deng pushes for more ecnomics reforms and openness
**1993-2007**
- China moves beyond the dual track system > allowing the market to control prices
- End of 1993: *material planning* abolished 
- Updating and strengthening of government as a regulator and economic policy maker
- SOEs reformed

## Chinese Data Quality
**Warnings when interpreting Chinese Data**
- Fast growing economies are hard to measure
	+ Rates of change in all variables so high
- Economies going under transitions or shifts can be difficult to measure
- Statistical Changes (measurement systems and technicques), error in collection, historical record and adjustments, and sheer size
- Data collected by the central government from smaller businesses gives them incentives to "correct" or distort data at each level


# Chinese Investment
*Q* How efficient is Chinese Investment
- Chinese investment is clearly driving growth, but
	1. How efficient are the investments, and is it all be used efficiently
	2. Is there sufficient cash flow from projects to repay debts (i.e. JnJ debt for future patents)

- Since Savings = Investment, Chinese S-I has grown very high, with savings slightly higher
 
## Result of High Chinese Savings 
*Q* Why are savings high?
	1. Underdeveloped healthcare system (causing people to save in case of emergency)
	2. Lack of social safety nets, even for the elderly (retirement is a cost)
	3. Access to capital markets
	4. Investment in education (e.g. paying for college)
Since China has such high savings, it must do something with all these reserves, less they be susceptible to inflation and other forces.
Thus, Chinese banks must give out loans often.

Note: This has create an interdependent relationship between China and the US. While we have high consumer spending, they have high savings.
While, the US has high debt, the Chinese need to distribute loans. We buy products and take out loans, they produce products and make money
from interest rates

*Savings must always flow somewhere*
* Options for Savings: 
  	+ flow into chinese banking system -> overinvestment
	+ flow into domestic real estate -> bubble
	+ flow into stock market -> driving up prices
	+ flow into corporate/SOE sector leading to corporate debt issues
	+ Leak abroad (creating asset bubbles in foreign real estate, stocks, etc.)

# Conclusion
- China has shown major slow downs in GDP growth, which is normal for a country as it reaches optimal development
- China has seen weak trade data in some recent years, and its not like there are more people to trade with globally
	+ China will not be able to continue their same growth benchmarks, thus the Chinese economy needs a *rebalance*
